# Spam Reporting endpoint for Slack

This is a basic implementation of a spam reporting endpoint for Slack.\
POST requests sent to this endpoint with a Type of SpamNotification will be sent to a Slack Channel. \
Note: This implementation uses Slack Webhooks which can not be posted in a public repo.\
Use your own webhook in a .env file or contact Joseph Supples for access to the webhook and workspace used to test this functionality
